## Introduction to GPU Clusters

GPU clusters are the foundation of enterprise AI infrastructure, enabling distributed training of large models and high-throughput inference at scale.

### Why GPU Clusters?

1. **Scale Beyond Single Node**: Train models too large for one server
2. **Faster Training**: Distribute workload across many GPUs
3. **Higher Throughput**: Serve more inference requests
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operating if nodes fail
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Share expensive GPU resources

### Cluster Size Considerations

**Small Cluster (2-8 nodes, 16-64 GPUs):**
- Use case: Single team, medium models, dev/test
- Cost: $100K-$500K
- Network: 100 GbE, single switch
- Cooling: Standard datacenter

**Medium Cluster (8-32 nodes, 64-256 GPUs):**
- Use case: Multiple teams, large models (up to 100B params)
- Cost: $500K-$2M
- Network: 200-400 GbE, spine-leaf
- Cooling: Enhanced cooling required

**Large Cluster (32-128 nodes, 256-1024 GPUs):**
- Use case: Enterprise ML platform, foundation models
- Cost: $2M-$10M+
- Network: 400 GbE-3.2 Tbps, large-scale fabric
- Cooling: Dedicated cooling infrastructure

**Superscale Cluster (128+ nodes, 1024+ GPUs):**
- Use case: Training LLMs (100B-1T params), research labs
- Cost: $10M-$100M+
- Network: Custom fabric, InfiniBand or RoCE
- Cooling: Liquid cooling, dedicated power substations

### Design Goals

1. **High Bandwidth**: Minimize communication overhead
2. **Low Latency**: Fast GPU-to-GPU communication
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add more nodes
4. **Reliability**: Minimize single points of failure
5. **Manageability**: Easy to monitor and maintain
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize price/performance

## Cluster Architecture Principles

### Compute Architecture

**Node Types:**

```
1. Training Nodes (GPU-dense)
   ├── 8x NVIDIA A100/H100 SXM
   ├── 2x AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon (CPU)
   ├── 2TB+ RAM
   ├── NVLink/NVSwitch for intra-node
   └── 8x 200Gbps network (ConnectX-7)

   ├── RAID controllers
   └── High network bandwidth
```

### Cluster Topology

**Flat Topology** (Small clusters, <8 nodes):
```
[Node 1] ─┐
[Node 2] ─┤
[Node 3] ─┼─ [Single Switch] ─ [Storage]
[Node 4] ─┤
[Node 5] ─┘
```

Pros: Simple, low latency
Cons: Limited scalability, single point of failure

**Spine-Leaf Topology** (Medium to large clusters):
```
        [Spine 1]     [Spine 2]     [Spine 3]
         /  |  \       /  |  \       /  |  \
        /   |   \     /   |   \     /   |   \
    [Leaf1][Leaf2][Leaf3][Leaf4][Leaf5][Leaf6]
      |  |   |  |   |  |   |  |   |  |   |  |
    Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes
```

Pros: Scalable, redundant paths, predictable latency
Cons: More complex, higher cost

**Fat Tree Topology** (Large clusters):
```
              [Core Switches]
            /      |      |      \
        [Aggregation Switches]
        /    |    |    |    |    \
    [ToR Switches]
     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
   Nodes with GPUs
```

Pros: High bisection bandwidth, scales well
Cons: Complex, expensive

### Network Requirements

**Bandwidth Calculations:**

For 8 GPUs with data parallel training:
```
All-reduce traffic per step:
  Model size: 10B params × 2 bytes (FP16) = 20GB
  All-reduce: 2 × 20GB = 40GB per step (ring algorithm)
  If 100ms per step, need: 40GB / 0.1s = 400 GB/s total

With 8 GPUs:
  Per-GPU bandwidth: 400 GB/s / 8 = 50 GB/s = 400 Gbps

Add overhead (20%): 480 Gbps per GPU
```

For multi-node (64 GPUs across 8 nodes):
```
Inter-node all-reduce traffic:
  Each node needs to communicate with 7 others
  Traffic per node: 40GB × 7 / 8 = 35GB per step
  Bandwidth per node: 35GB / 0.1s = 350 GB/s = 2.8 Tbps

Use 8x 400GbE links per node (3.2 Tbps total)
```

## Network Topology and Fabric

### Ethernet vs. InfiniBand

**Ethernet (RoCE - RDMA over Converged Ethernet):**

Pros:
- Standard, interoperable
- Lower cost
- Familiar to ops teams
- Scales well

Cons:
- Higher latency than IB
- More CPU overhead
- Requires careful tuning

**InfiniBand:**

Pros:
- Lower latency
- Higher efficiency
- Better for HPC workloads
- Mature RDMA support

Cons:
- Higher cost
- Proprietary (Mellanox/NVIDIA)
- Requires specialized knowledge
- Limited vendor choice

**Recommendation**:
- Ethernet (RoCE) for most AI clusters
- InfiniBand for largest scale or lowest latency requirements

### NVIDIA ConnectX NICs

**ConnectX-7** (Latest generation):
- 400 Gbps (NDR InfiniBand or 400GbE)
- RDMA support
- GPUDirect RDMA (bypass CPU)
- In-network computing (SHARP)
- PCIe Gen 5

**GPUDirect RDMA:**
Direct GPU-to-GPU communication over network without CPU involvement:

```
Traditional Path:
GPU Memory → PCIe → CPU Memory → PCIe → NIC → Network
                                 ↓
                         High latency, CPU overhead

GPUDirect RDMA Path:
GPU Memory → PCIe → NIC → Network
         ↓
  Low latency, no CPU
```

### SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol)

SHARP offloads collective operations (all-reduce) to the network switches:

```
Without SHARP:
Each GPU sends to all others
├── N×(N-1) messages
└── High bandwidth usage

With SHARP:
Network switches perform in-network reduction
├── Logarithmic message complexity
└── Lower bandwidth, lower latency
```

### Network Configuration

**NCCL Network Tuning:**

```bash
# Enable GPUDirect RDMA
export NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=5

# Use all available NICs
export NCCL_IB_HCA=mlx5_0,mlx5_1,mlx5_2,mlx5_3

# Enable SHARP (if available)
export NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

# Tune NCCL algorithms
export NCCL_ALGO=Tree,Ring  # Use both algorithms
export NCCL_PROTO=Simple    # Use simple protocol for large messages

# Set network interface
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0

# Debug (verbose output)
export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
```

**Network Topology Awareness:**

```bash
# NCCL can detect topology automatically
# Or specify manually:
export NCCL_TOPO_FILE=/path/to/topology.xml

# Topology file specifies GPU-GPU and GPU-NIC connections
```

Example topology XML:
```xml
<system version="1">
  <cpu numaid="0" affinity="0000ffff">
    <pci busid="0000:00:00.0">
      <gpu dev="0"/>
      <nic dev="mlx5_0"/>
    </pci>
  </cpu>
</system>
```

## NVSwitch and GPU Fabric

### NVLink Architecture

NVLink provides high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU interconnect:

**NVLink Generations:**

| Generation | GPUs | Bandwidth/Link | Links/GPU | Total BW/GPU |
|------------|------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| NVLink 2.0 | V100 | 25 GB/s | 6 | 300 GB/s |
| NVLink 3.0 | A100 | 50 GB/s | 12 | 600 GB/s |
| NVLink 4.0 | H100 | 50 GB/s | 18 | 900 GB/s |

**Direct NVLink Connection** (2-4 GPUs):
```
GPU 0 ←→ GPU 1
  ↕        ↕
GPU 2 ←→ GPU 3

Each GPU connected to 3 others via NVLink
Mesh topology for 4 GPUs
```

### NVSwitch

NVSwitch enables full NVLink connectivity for 8+ GPUs:

**NVSwitch Architecture:**

```
         [NVSwitch]
    /    /    |    \    \
   /    /     |     \    \
GPU0 GPU1  GPU2  GPU3  GPU4 ... GPU7

Each GPU has 12 (A100) or 18 (H100) NVLink connections
All connected through NVSwitch
Any GPU can communicate with any other at full NVLink speed
```

**Benefits:**
- Full bisection bandwidth
- Any-to-any connectivity
- All-reduce bandwidth = Single GPU NVLink bandwidth
- Scales to 256 GPUs with NVSwitch systems

**NVSwitch Generations:**

| Version | GPUs | NVLink Gen | Ports | Switch BW |
|---------|------|------------|-------|-----------|
| NVSwitch 1.0 | V100 | 2.0 | 18 | 900 GB/s |
| NVSwitch 2.0 | A100 | 3.0 | 36 | 7.2 TB/s |
| NVSwitch 3.0 | H100 | 4.0 | 64 | 13.6 TB/s |

### Multi-Node NVSwitch Fabric

**DGX SuperPOD** (32 DGX nodes, 256 GPUs):
```
Each DGX: 8 GPUs with NVSwitch (full connectivity within node)
    ↓
Connect DGX nodes via 8×200GbE per node
    ↓
Network fabric provides inter-node connectivity
    ↓
NCCL routes traffic: intra-node via NVLink, inter-node via Ethernet
```

- High sequential read throughput
- Moderate IOPS

**Checkpoints:**
- Frequent writes during training
- Large files (10-100 GB per checkpoint)
- High write throughput needed

**Inference:**
- Model weights (GB to 100s of GB)
- Low latency reads
- High IOPS for model serving

### Storage Architecture

**Parallel Filesystem** (Training):
```
Example: DDN EXAScaler, VAST Data, WekaFS

Architecture:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Parallel File System         │
│  (metadata + data servers)       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
    [High-speed network]
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│    Compute Nodes (DGX)          │
│  Mount shared filesystem         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Performance:
- 100+ GB/s aggregate throughput
- Millions of IOPS
- Scales with more servers
```

**Object Storage** (Archive):
```
Example: S3, Ceph, MinIO

Use cases:
- Dataset archive
- Long-term checkpoint storage
- Model registry

Cost-effective, scales to exabytes
```

**Local NVMe** (Fast scratch):
```
Each DGX has 30TB NVMe:
- Stage datasets locally before training
- Fast checkpoint writes
- Temporary file operations

100+ GB/s per node
```

### Storage Best Practices

1. **Tiered Storage**:
   - Hot: NVMe (local or fabric)
   - Warm: Parallel filesystem
   - Cold: Object storage

2. **Data Loading Optimization**:
   - Pre-stage datasets to local NVMe
   - Use data loaders with prefetching
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Checkpoint Strategy**:
   - Write checkpoints to fast storage
   - Asynchronously copy to long-term storage
   - Keep only recent N checkpoints on fast storage

4. **Bandwidth Planning**:
```
64 GPUs training ResNet-50:
- Batch size: 32 per GPU
- Images: 224×224×3 bytes = 150 KB
- Total per step: 64 × 32 × 150 KB = 307 MB
- At 100 steps/sec: 30.7 GB/s needed

Add 50% margin: 46 GB/s aggregate storage bandwidth
```
