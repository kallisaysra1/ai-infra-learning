A: You can test out of modules by passing the quiz and demonstrating competency.

**Q: Do I need access to expensive GPU resources?**
A: Most labs can be completed with cloud credits (AWS, GCP provide free tiers). Some projects require GPU access, but we provide alternatives.

**Q: How is this different from cloud provider certifications?**
A: This is vendor-neutral, focuses on production ML infrastructure specifically, and includes hands-on projects rather than just theory.

**Q: Can I use this for corporate training?**
A: Yes! The curriculum is MIT licensed. Contact us for bulk access and customization.

**Q: What comes after completing this level?**
A: The AI Infrastructure Architect curriculum (coming soon) or specialized roles in ML platform engineering.
