# Exercise 03 — Design a Measurement Plan

**Estimated time**: 3 hours
**Deliverable**: A measurement plan for one system, ≤ 2 pages

---

## The scenario

You are the CAO at **Tessera Bank** (continuity from
mod-101 Exercise 04). The AI-assisted small-business
loan-decisioning system has cleared MAP — the impact
assessment is complete and the AI Review Board has
classified the risks. You now need to design the
**measurement plan**.

The relevant risks from the impact assessment (use the
taxonomy from §2.2 or Exercise 01):

1. **Performance risk** — model recommendation accuracy
   drifts as the small-business economy changes.
2. **Bias and fairness risk** — recommendation patterns
   show disparate impact across protected classes.
3. **Transparency risk** — adverse-action notices cannot
   meaningfully explain individual decisions.
4. **Privacy and data risk** — the cash-flow aggregator
   (third-party data source) exposes data beyond intended
   purpose.
5. **Operational risk** — the third-party aggregator goes
   down, model loses input.
6. **Compliance risk** — fair-lending obligations not
   continuously demonstrable.

## Your assignment

Produce a measurement plan that includes, for each of the
six risks:

1. **At least one *leading* indicator** (per §4.1 — true
   leading, not relabeled lagging).
2. **At least one *lagging* indicator** for verification.
3. **Threshold** — a specific numeric or categorical
   threshold, set *before* you have production data on it.
4. **Data source** — where the data comes from.
5. **Cadence** — how often the indicator is computed and
   reviewed.
6. **Response when threshold is crossed** — concrete,
   not "we discuss it".
7. **Owner** — named role.

## Required structure

A table per risk:

```
### Risk N — (taxonomy category)

Leading indicator
  - Metric:
  - Data source:
  - Cadence:
  - Threshold:
  - Response:
  - Owner:

Lagging indicator
  - Metric:
  - Data source:
  - Cadence:
  - Threshold:
  - Response:
  - Owner:
```

Followed by a short *plan-level* section:

- **Dashboard design** — what audience sees what, on what
  cadence.
- **Eval-set inventory** — for any leading indicator that
  depends on an eval set, name the eval set, its
  provenance, refresh cadence.
- **Cross-cutting concerns** — anything that affects
  multiple risks (e.g., the third-party aggregator's
  reliability indicator covers both privacy and
  operational risk).

## Constraints

- **2 pages.** Hard limit.
- Each leading indicator must be *substantively* leading.
  If your "leading" indicator is "number of complaints
  in last 7 days", it is lagging-relabeled and the
  exercise has not been done.
- Each threshold must be defined **without reference to
  current production values**. If your threshold is "20%
  worse than current", that is acceptable only as a
  starting threshold; the absolute value must also be
  given.
- Every threshold must have a **specific named response**
  — what gets done, by whom, on what timeline.
- The plan must explicitly **name the eval set** for any
  metric depending on one and acknowledge its
  refresh cadence.

## Rubric

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---|
| Coverage — leading + lagging per risk | 15% |
| Leading indicators — substantively leading | 25% |
| Thresholds — defined absolutely, not just relatively | 15% |
| Responses — concrete, owned, time-bounded | 15% |
| Eval-set discipline — named, provenance, refresh cadence | 15% |
| Cross-cutting concerns — surfaced | 10% |
| Length discipline — ≤ 2 pages | 5% |
