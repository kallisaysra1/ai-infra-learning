# Module 101 — Quiz

Twenty questions covering the lecture material. Most have a
single best answer; a few are short-answer. Recommended use:
work the quiz at the end of the module, score yourself, then
revisit the lecture sections where you missed questions.

Answer key lives in the paired solutions repo:
[`ai-infra-chief-ai-officer-solutions / modules/mod-101-foundations/quiz-key.md`](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-chief-ai-officer-solutions/blob/main/modules/mod-101-foundations/quiz-key.md)

## Section A — Vocabulary (§1)

**Q1.** Which of the following best distinguishes AI governance
from AI compliance?

  a. Governance is about what you *should* do; compliance is
     about what you *are required to* do.
  b. Governance is about *who decides and how you know it
     worked*; compliance is about *external rules you must
     satisfy*.
  c. Governance is broader because it includes ethics;
     compliance is a subset.
  d. There is no meaningful distinction in practice.

**Q2.** True or false: Model risk management is a *category
within* AI governance, not a parallel discipline.

**Q3.** Name two of the three forces the lecture notes
identified as having created AI governance as a named
discipline in the post-2022 era.

## Section B — NIST AI RMF (§2)

**Q4.** Which NIST AI RMF function is described as operating
*continuously across* the other three?

  a. MAP
  b. MEASURE
  c. MANAGE
  d. GOVERN

**Q5.** Which artifact most clearly belongs to MAP rather than
MEASURE?

  a. A dashboard tracking model evaluation scores over time
  b. An AI system inventory with use-case classifications
  c. A risk treatment plan
  d. A quarterly board report

**Q6.** Short answer: in one sentence, explain why a
governance program that "passes NIST AI RMF" can still be a
failed program.

## Section C — Three Lines of Defense (§3)

**Q7.** In a 3LOD model applied to AI, which of the following
is a **second-line** function?

  a. The ML platform team that runs the training infrastructure
  b. The AI risk function that authors the policy hierarchy
  c. Internal audit
  d. The product manager for an AI feature

**Q8.** Which of these arrangements **breaks** 3LOD
independence?

  a. AI risk function reports to the Chief Risk Officer
  b. Internal audit reports to the audit committee
  c. AI risk function reports to the Chief Technology Officer
  d. AI ethics committee includes both first- and second-line
     members but the chair is from the second line

**Q9.** Short answer: describe one symptom of *cosmetic
independence* in a 3LOD model.

## Section D — The CAO role (§4)

**Q10.** Which of these is **not** part of the core scope of
a CAO as described in §4?

  a. Ownership of the AI risk register
  b. Ownership of model selection decisions
  c. Ownership of the AI policy hierarchy
  d. Co-signing external AI trust attestations

**Q11.** Which reporting line is identified in §4 as
breaking 3LOD?

  a. CAO → CEO
  b. CAO → CRO
  c. CAO → CTO
  d. CAO → COO

**Q12.** True or false: The lecture notes claim that every
organization that has AI in production needs a Chief AI
Officer.

**Q13.** Match each peer role to the boundary the CAO owns
*at the intersection*:

| Peer | Intersection (write the letter) |
|---|---|
| CISO | __ |
| CDO (Data) | __ |
| General Counsel | __ |

  a. Regulatory engagement strategy + filings
  b. AI-specific threat models + AI incident classification
  c. Training-data provenance + downstream use restrictions

**Q14.** Short answer: which CAO anti-pattern from §4 is most
likely to develop in an org that *retitles* a senior ML
researcher to "Chief AI Officer" without changing their
accountabilities? Explain in one sentence.

## Section E — Operating models (§5)

**Q15.** Which operating model is described as the **most
common mature pattern** for mid-to-large organizations?

  a. Centralized
  b. Federated
  c. Hub-and-spoke
  d. Distributed-without-hub

**Q16.** What is the **primary weakness** of a fully federated
governance operating model?

  a. Cost
  b. Inconsistency across business units
  c. Slow regulatory response
  d. Lack of executive sponsorship

**Q17.** Short answer: name one organization type for which a
**centralized** operating model is likely the best fit, and
say why in one sentence.

## Section F — Failure modes (§6)

**Q18.** Which failure mode is described by the symptom *"the
governance team's main work becomes processing exceptions"*?

  a. Governance theatre
  b. Control sprawl
  c. Regulatory whiplash
  d. Vendor capture

**Q19.** Which failure mode is described by the symptom *"the
policy hierarchy maps directly to regulators, not to risks"*?

  a. Governance theatre
  b. Control sprawl
  c. Regulatory whiplash
  d. Compliance-only stance

**Q20.** Short answer: in two sentences, contrast the
*compliance-only stance* failure mode (§6) with the
*governance theatre* failure mode. Where do they overlap, and
where do they differ?
